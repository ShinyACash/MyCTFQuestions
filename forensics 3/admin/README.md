# Cat Files

Description: 
My cat and it's friends have been plotting on something but I don't know what. My cat's been using my PC and seemed to have sent this disk image file to it's friends but I cant seem to carve files out of it. I could write a python script to tackle this but I just can't find the magic number!! I haven't eaten today 'cause of this.
