Forensics 1:

Ciao Detective! 1

Desc:
You are assigned to investigate suspicious activity in Italy. You got hold of a singular network traffic file which seems to have information about 
how suspects have been trying to pass their plans within themselves. You got a case file of one particular suspect named Wario. He seems to be the mastermind behind
the criminal activities lately but no one has proof against him. If you find proofs against him then the agency can finally arrest him. You open the case file
and all you see is one sentence, "Suspect likes to drink fernet-branca.". Perhaps the person making the case file was a newbie.
